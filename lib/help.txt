This API enables cross-origin requests to anywhere.

Usage:

/               Shows help
/iscorsneeded   This is the only resource on this host which is served without CORS headers.
/<url>          Create a request to <url>, and includes CORS headers in the response.

If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to http (https if port 443 is specified).

Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.

The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header. Non-existence of this
header implies that the requested URL was not recognized.

To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the Origin
or the X-Requested-With header to be set. To avoid unnecessary preflight (OPTIONS) requests,
it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code.

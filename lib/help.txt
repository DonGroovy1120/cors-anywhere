This API enables cross-origin requests to anywhere.

Usage:

/               Shows help
/iscorsneeded   This is the only resource on this host which is served without CORS headers.
/<url>          Create a request to <url>, and includes CORS headers in the response.

If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to http (https if port 443 is specified).

Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.

Redirects are not automatically followed: The API response has status code 333.
The client ought to confirm this redirection by creating a new request (the url
is available in the Location response header).
For user agents who do not support the Access-Control-Expose-Headers response header,
the information is available in the status text as "<HTTP STATUS CODE> <LOCATION HEADER>".


The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header. Non-existence of this
header implies that the requested URL was not recognized.

This API has one requirement: The X-Requested-With header must be set.

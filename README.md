**CORS Anywhere** is a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.

The url to proxy is literally taken from the path, validated and proxied. The protocol
part of the proxied URI is optional, and defaults to "http". If port 443 is specified,
the protocol defaults to "https".

This package does not put any restrictions on the http methods or headers, except for
cookies. Requesting [user credentials](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#user-credentials) is disallowed.
The app can be configured to require a header for proxying a request, for example to avoid
a direct visit from the browser.

The package also includes a Procfile, to run the app on Heroku. More information about
Heroku can be found at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs.

## Example

```javascript
// Heroku defines the environment variable PORT, and requires the binding address to be 0.0.0.0
var host = process.env.PORT ? '0.0.0.0' : '127.0.0.1';
var port = process.env.PORT || 8080;

var cors_proxy = require('cors-anywhere');
cors_proxy.createServer({
    originWhitelist: [], // Allow all origins
    requireHeader: ['origin', 'x-requested-with'],
    removeHeaders: ['cookie', 'cookie2']
}).listen(port, host, function() {
    console.log('Running CORS Anywhere on ' + host + ':' + port);
});

```
Request examples:

* `http://localhost:8080/http://google.com/` - Google.com with CORS headers
* `http://localhost:8080/google.com` - Same as previous.
* `http://localhost:8080/google.com:443` - Proxies `https://google.com/`
* `http://localhost:8080/` - Shows usage text, as defined in `libs/help.txt`
* `http://localhost:8080/favicon.ico` - Replies 404 Not found

Live examples:

* https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
* https://robwu.nl/cors-anywhere.html - This demo shows how to use the API.

## Documentation

### Client

To use the API, just prefix the URL with the API URL. Take a look at [demo.html](demo.html) for an example.
A concise summary of the documentation is provided at [lib/help.txt](lib/help.txt).

If you want to automatically enable cross-domain requests when needed, use the following snippet:

```javascript
(function() {
    var cors_api_host = 'cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com';
    var cors_api_url = 'https://' + cors_api_host + '/';
    var slice = [].slice;
    var origin = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host;
    var open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
    XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function() {
        var args = slice.call(arguments);
        var targetOrigin = /^https?:\/\/([^\/]+)/i.exec(args[1]);
        if (targetOrigin && targetOrigin[0].toLowerCase() !== origin &&
            targetOrigin[1] !== cors_api_host) {
            args[1] = cors_api_url + args[1];
        }
        return open.apply(this, args);
    };
})();
```

If you're using jQuery, you can also use the following code **instead of** the previous one:

```javascript
jQuery.ajaxPrefilter(function(options) {
    if (options.crossDomain && jQuery.support.cors) {
        options.url = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/' + options.url;
    }
});
```

### Server

The module exports `createServer(options)`, which creates a server that handles
proxy requests. The following options are supported:

* function `getProxyForUrl` - If set, specifies which intermediate proxy to use for a given URL.
  If the return value is void, a direct request is sent. The default implementation is
  [`proxy-from-env`](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env), which respects the standard proxy
  environment variables (e.g. `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, etc.).  
* array of strings `originBlacklist` - If set, requests whose origin is listed are blocked.  
  Example: `['https://bad.example.com', 'http://bad.example.com']`
* array of strings `originWhitelist` - If set, requests whose origin is not listed are blocked.  
  If this list is empty, all origins are allowed.
  Example: `['https://good.example.com', 'http://good.example.com']`
* boolean `redirectSameOrigin` - If true, requests to URLs from the same origin will not be proxied but redirected.
  The primary purpose for this option is to save server resources by delegating the request to the client
  (since same-origin requests should always succeed, even without proxying).
* array of strings `requireHeader` - If set, the request must include this header or the API will refuse to proxy.  
  Recommended if you want to prevent users from using the proxy for normal browsing.  
  Example: `['Origin', 'X-Requested-With']`.
* array of lowercase strings `removeHeaders` - Exclude certain headers from being included in the request.  
  Example: `["cookie"]`
* dictionary of lowercase strings `setHeaders` - Set headers for the request (overwrites existing ones).  
  Example: `{"x-powered-by": "CORS Anywhere"}`
* string `helpFile` - Set the help file (shown at the homepage).  
  Example: `"myCustomHelpText.txt"`

For advanced users, the following options are also provided.

* `httpProxyOptions` - Under the hood, [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy)
  is used to proxy requests. Use this option if you really need to pass options
  to http-proxy. The documentation for these options can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options).
* `httpsOptions` - If set, a `https.Server` will be created. The given options are passed to the
  [`https.createServer`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_createserver_options_requestlistener) method.
